# Introduction

(Based on a true story...)

We came across a company that decided to implement its own heap. Let's break it!

In this first challenge, there is a heap that uses the final block for system
specific purposes and it is inaccessible to the end user. Or is it?

Needed lib32gcc-10-dev package to compile this as 32 bit at all on ubuntu 20
